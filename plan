Near term goals in order of priority:

1) Build AI to make pilots unique and more realistic. 
  1.1) AI pilots must observe and be limited in their observations.
  1.2) AI pilots must make decisions in accordance to their personality. 
  1.3) Decisions need not be brutally deterministic or hyper-realistic. 
  1.4) Events which would affect a human pilot must affect AI pilots. AI pilots' personalities will be faceted and mutable.
  1.5) All of this will probably entail disabling many components of the original game's AI.
  
2) Warp system will be scrapped and replaced with new system.
  2.1) Jumping will only occur at gates located at a system's primary.
  2.2) Connections among systems will periodically shift. Some systems will rarely be accessible.
